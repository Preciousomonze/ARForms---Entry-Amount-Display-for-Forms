# ARForms - Entry Amount Display for Forms
Description: This Plugin helps print out the counted number of enteries for a particular form via the shortcode <strong><code>[pk_ARForms_entry_count form_id="{id}"]</code> replace {id} with an actual form id :)</strong>. This plugin is fully dependent on ARForms Plugin, therefore requires Arforms builder plugin to be active.
